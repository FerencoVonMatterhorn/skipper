# What is skipper?

Skipper is heavily inspired by the awesome [Kapitan](https://kapitan.dev/) tool. The major difference
is that skipper is primarily meant to be used as library. This allows you for example to have way more
control over the data-structures used inside the templates. 

## TODO

- [ ] `<no value>` detection in rendered templates
  - If for some reason a template uses a value which is not set, the user should have the ability to detect that post generation.
  - Introduce a verify mechanism which ideally checks for missing values and maybe also extracts which template-key it originated from
